# Dunia Yetu
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to deliver a set of tools and a platform in East Africa which allows thousands of coders to create their own digital sovereign Internet within two years. 
The following capabilities will be prioritized:
- The ability of all platform members to publish and access all video, audio and web information.
- The ability to use a locally hosted co-owned AI system to expand local knowledge and allow everyone to find what they are looking for.
- The ability for every coder to create the best possible experiences with at least 3x less effort (10x is the future aim).
- The ability to manage collaboration, co-creation, co-working, co-living etc.  
- A regulated p2p ecommerce platform with payments & payment gateways. 
- The ability of all platform members to manage their own data and use this as fabric for a future digital society.
- A funding mechanism for startups to realize their vision.
The following should apply:
- There is no lock in (no-one can use their preferred position to extract more value than they should).
- An alternative financing system does not rely on Interest (debt) but rather on pre-purchase & co-ownership.
- There is no need to pay for the act of publishing or finding information, services, products. Everything can be found free and in the easiest way.
## Requirements
### Everything we do prioritizes our chosen value
- Planet/People First
- OpenSource/Authenticity/Simplicity as tools for above
### Inclusive
- Everyone should be able to use these services/experiences.
- Even the poorest people should be able to afford such a digital life.
- All experiences eventually need to be available in the local language.
- Eventually all of experiences should be accessible through multiple interfaces
    - Conversational (Audio/Text)
    - Web/Wiki/Form based
    - Augmented Reality/VR
- Even the cheapest devices should be able to access the core features.
- We are building a platform which can be used by everyone to build their own required experiences on top of.
- All information needed to expand on the system is open source and available through multiple channels and media so everyone can quickly learn how to build out the system and develop their own experiences.
- IT is not a purpose by itself, it's a tool to achieve business, government, and community goals. We always need to put the capabilities of the platform in line with the requirements of the end goals.

### A Sovereign Future
- Data is owned by the user (100%): they can define where it is stored, can delete it at any time and the data can never be corrupted.
- All logic running on the data is owned by the user and the user can choose the location of this logic. 
- The code running that logic is always open source and can be checked by the community.
- Communication between participants is always as local as possible (this saves heavily on bandwidth).
- Security and privacy are a strong requirement for communication, digital logic and data storage.
- We use mutual credit (micropayment which is possible offline) to pay and sell the services of the platform.
### Simplicity
- We create the most straightforward user experience meaning that users do not have to become experts.
- We avoid the duplication of the core of digital life so there is only:
    - 1 identity
    - 1 messaging/chat/mail backend system
    - 1 file/video/image/music storage and distribution system
    - 1 project/circle/dao/task management backend system 
- We will avoid overly complicated or abstracted frameworks and coding practices.
### Reliability
- Data can never be lost nor corrupted.
- Maximizes the chance to keep the network running even if larger scale - disturbances happen as more data is stored locally. 
- The ability to access payments, data, pools of knowledge etc. offline is prioritized.
